## Why use TOR inside WindowsSanbox?
Because of this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/comments/tif9pp/question_about_tor_browser_and_the_windows_release/)   
But also because using the TOR browser inside a vm like windows sandbox should somewhat remove any possible tracking fingerprinting nonsense  
If you want absolute anonimity just use something like TAILS or WHONIX   
    
But if you use windows and want a super convenient way to use the TOR network but still have somewhat isolation from your real hardware    
Then this is repo for you!   
## How to use?
```
PS: cd Desktop
PS: git clone   
PS: WindowsSandbox TorSandbox\TorSanbox.wsb  
```
If you want you can move the custom shortcut anywhere you want and even pin it to the taskbar    
The shortcut also has a custom icon that is broken in some smaller sizes (Maybe ill fix in near future)
